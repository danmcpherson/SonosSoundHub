## 🚀 Get Started

### Option 1: Pre-Built Raspberry Pi (Easiest)

**Want a plug-and-play solution?** I offer pre-configured Raspberry Pi units with Sonos Sound Hub ready to go.

📧 **Visit [Sonos Sound Hub](https://sonossoundhub.etsy.com)** for pricing and availability.

Just plug it in, connect to your network, and you're ready to control your Sonos system.

---

### Option 2: Install on Your Own Raspberry Pi

#### One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://danmcpherson.github.io/SonosSoundHub/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/sonos-sound-hub.gpg
ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
echo "deb [arch=${ARCH} signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sonos-sound-hub.gpg] https://danmcpherson.github.io/SonosSoundHub stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sonos-sound-hub.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sonos-sound-hub
```

Then install the required [soco-cli](https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli) dependency:
```bash
pipx install soco-cli
```

Allow the service to bind to port 80 (run once after install):
```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/sonos-sound-hub/api
```

**Start on boot:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sonos-sound-hub
sudo systemctl start sonos-sound-hub
```

**Access the UI:** Open `http://<your-pi-ip>/` (port 80) in any browser.

**Optional: Install MCP Server for AI Assistants:**
```bash
cd /opt/sonos-sound-hub/sonos-mcp-server
sudo python3 -m venv .venv
sudo .venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

---

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer (32-bit or 64-bit Pi OS)
- Python 3.11+ with `pipx`
- Your Pi must be on the same network as your Sonos speakers

---

## 📱 Add to Your Home Screen

Sonos Sound Hub works as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Add it to your home screen for an app-like experience:

**iPhone/iPad:** Open the URL in Safari → tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"

**Android:** Open the URL in Chrome → tap the menu → "Add to Home screen"

---

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration (MCP Server)

Sonos Sound Hub includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot control your Sonos system through natural language.

### Setup

1. **Install the MCP server** (requires Python 3.10+):
   ```bash
   cd /opt/sonos-sound-hub/sonos-mcp-server
   python3 -m venv .venv
   .venv/bin/pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Configure your AI tool:**

   **Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "sonos": {
         "command": "/opt/sonos-sound-hub/sonos-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["-m", "sonos_mcp_server"],
         "env": {
           "SONOS_API_URL": "http://your-pi-ip:80"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "sonos": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "/path/to/sonos-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["-m", "sonos_mcp_server"],
         "env": {
           "SONOS_API_URL": "http://your-pi-ip:80"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart your AI application** to load the new tools.

### Example Commands

Once configured, you can use natural language:
- *"What Sonos speakers are available?"*
- *"Play my Jazz playlist on the Kitchen speaker"*
- *"Set the Living Room volume to 40"*
- *"Run the morning routine macro"*
- *"Group all speakers for party mode"*

### Available Tools

The MCP server exposes 28 tools for complete Sonos control:
- Speaker discovery and status
- Playback control (play, pause, next, previous)
- Volume and mute control
- Speaker grouping and party mode
- Favorites, playlists, and radio stations
- Queue management
- Macro execution

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Speakers not found | Ensure your Pi is on the same network as your Sonos speakers |
| Can't access the UI | Check that the service is running: `sudo systemctl status sonos-sound-hub` |
| Port already in use | Another app is using port 80 or 8000. Stop it or change ports in settings |
| Permission denied on startup | Grant low-port bind: `sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/sonos-sound-hub/api` or add `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in the systemd unit |

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't be possible without the incredible work of the [**SoCo**](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) team and [**soco-cli**](https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli).

**SoCo** (Sonos Controller) is the Python library that enables programmatic control of Sonos speakers. **soco-cli** provides the command-line interface that Sonos Sound Hub uses under the hood to communicate with your Sonos system.

A huge thank you to the maintainers and contributors of these open-source projects for making Sonos automation accessible to everyone.
