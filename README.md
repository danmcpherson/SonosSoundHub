## 🚀 Get Started

### Option 1: Pre-Built Raspberry Pi (Easiest)

**Want a plug-and-play solution?** I offer pre-configured Raspberry Pi units with Sonos Sound Hub ready to go.

📧 **Email [sonoshub@dmcemail.com](mailto:sonoshub@dmcemail.com)** for pricing and availability.

Just plug it in, connect to your network, and you're ready to control your Sonos system.

### Option 2: Install on Your Own Raspberry Pi

#### One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://danmcpherson.github.io/SonosSoundHub/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/sonos-sound-hub.gpg
ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
echo "deb [arch=${ARCH} signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sonos-sound-hub.gpg] https://danmcpherson.github.io/SonosSoundHub stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sonos-sound-hub.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sonos-sound-hub
```

Then install the required [soco-cli](https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli) dependency:
```bash
pipx install soco-cli
```

Allow the service to bind to port 80 (run once after install):
```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/sonos-sound-hub/api
```

**Start on boot:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sonos-sound-hub
sudo systemctl start sonos-sound-hub
```

**Access the UI:** Open `http://<your-pi-ip>/` (port 80) in any browser.

---

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer (32-bit or 64-bit Pi OS)
- Python 3.11+ with `pipx`
- Your Pi must be on the same network as your Sonos speakers

---

## 📱 Add to Your Home Screen

Sonos Sound Hub works as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Add it to your home screen for an app-like experience:

**iPhone/iPad:** Open the URL in Safari → tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"

**Android:** Open the URL in Chrome → tap the menu → "Add to Home screen"

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Speakers not found | Ensure your Pi is on the same network as your Sonos speakers |
| Can't access the UI | Check that the service is running: `sudo systemctl status sonos-sound-hub` |
| Port already in use | Another app is using port 80 or 8000. Stop it or change ports in settings |
| Permission denied on startup | Grant low-port bind: `sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/sonos-sound-hub/api` or add `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in the systemd unit |
